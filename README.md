# Linear-Regression-Road-Accident-Analysis

Project Overview:

Road accidents are a significant concern worldwide, particularly in underdeveloped countries where traffic management systems may not be as advanced.This project aims to develop a linear regression model to analyze and predict the severity of road accidents. By leveraging a dataset with various factors such as vehicle speed, weather conditions, road conditions, vehicle conditions, and time of day, the model can identify high-risk scenarios and contribute to public education on road safety measures.

Dataset Description:

The dataset used for this project includes the following variables:
accident_severity: The severity of the accident (dependent variable).
speed: The speed of the vehicle at the time of the accident.
weather_condition: The weather condition during the accident (e.g., clear, rainy, foggy, snowy).
road_condition: The condition of the road (e.g., dry, wet, icy).
vehicle_condition: The condition of the vehicle (e.g., good, fair, poor).
time_of_day: The time of day when the accident occurred (e.g., morning, afternoon, evening, night).

Benefits of the Model:

This model can be beneficial for traffic accident analysis and prevention in underdeveloped countries in several ways:
Predictive Analysis: Helps predict the severity of accidents based on different factors, allowing authorities to take preemptive measures.
Resource Allocation: Identifies high-risk conditions, helping allocate resources such as emergency services more effectively.
Policy Making: Provides data-driven insights that can inform traffic regulations and infrastructure improvements to reduce accident severity.
Public Awareness: Educates the public about high-risk behaviors and conditions, leading to safer driving practices.
